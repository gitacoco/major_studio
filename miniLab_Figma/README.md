# Prototyping and Interactions in Figma 

## What is Figma and Why I like it (Compared to Sketch)

> Figma is a could-based collaborative interface design tool that compatible with any operating system. 

And the most important, it’s free for individual designers. These are my favorite 6 features of Figma:

1. Version Control
In programming, we use Git to records changes to a file over time so that we can recall specific versions later.  And traditionally, for UI design software we would manage our file like this way: 

<img src="./version_control.png" width="50%" height="50%">

![performance](./version_control.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

But in Figma, that would be a different story. And you never need to struggle with losing and juggling files. 

2. High-Performance Computing

Usually, when we have too many (actually it’s not too many) layers or elementals, the software tens to stutter or get lags. They would be too slow and don’t response in time. But Figma is cloud-based. It is a SaaS platform, like Gmail, Google Docs. So the computing process is in the cloud, and have a high performance.

4. High-efficiency Editing

Figma has lots of features to support Bulk Manipulation (such as change color, rename) and Quick Select. Take change color as an Example. In sketch, especially in nested layers, If we want to change color of a specific layer, we need to click click again and again to enter the target layer. But in Figma, this would not happen. 

5. Any Operating System

Windows, Mac OS & Linux, as long as you can run web browsers. And they also have a client application that supports offline editing. And there even is a third-party application in iPadOS called [Figurative]([Figurative – A Figma app for iPadOS](https://figurative.design)), supporting Apple Pencil and touch gestures. 
I once experienced it when I was away from home.

6. An Accelerator for your Design: UI Kits, Design Systems, Wireframes and Plugins in Community

Sometimes, you need to deliver a hi-fi prototype rapidly for your client. Even if you are still in the early stage of the project. Many clients they just have no clear idea of the outcome, and their needs. You need to show something first. So the case here is that you could make it with the help of UI kits in Figma community. For example, this is a firefighting situational awareness system for Xiamen City in China, this is for large-screen environment.  There was a day my client had a brainwave that they want an edition for cellphone. This is not a formal requirement, so I used UI kits in Figma to build a hi-fi mockup in 4 hours. But this is my only project I was using UI kit. (I never used them for Major Studio Projects!)
