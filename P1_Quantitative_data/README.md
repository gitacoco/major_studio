# Project 1: Visualize Quantitative Data
## Project Title
**Last Faces of Extinct Birds in North America**
*—— Scrutinizing the lifespans of extinct bird species*  
You can access the [video demo here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10he8j2Y-nkIiiT9rWQodgpLHfQhFkddu/view?usp=sharing) and the [interactive prototype here](https://www.figma.com/proto/Ew2tDcc3rdeNUJPzOaTEnr/Major-Studio-1-Project-1?node-id=1%3A2&viewport=798%2C473%2C0.10880535840988159&scaling=scale-down-width).

## Initial motivation
1. To digitize the bird specimen collections in museum, bringing them to the stage. And taking advantage of the web technology to enable more people to see the appearance of those extinct birds.
2. To draw people's attention and to evoke responses on the issue of birds’ habitat destruction caused by human activities.

## Questions

Museums always display animal specimen collections, such as bird specimens, on the wall in a matrix-like way, no matter far at National Museums of Kenya or nearly at the National Museum of Natural History of Smithsonian. In on-site settings, those layouts give people a special sense of rhythm and beauty. However, if we're talking about collection digitization, we may be able to do something more. Taking pictures and make them accessible online is still a replication of the traditional on-site exhibition, which has not taken advantage of the digital interfaces.
So questions:
1. How to incorporate multiple dimensions of Information on the basis of displaying specimens.
2. How to engage people to discover, explore the collections and get the information they want while our design goals is being achieved.

## Process
### Ideation Alternatives
![Image of Ideation](./sketches.jpg)
The first idea is to make an array, an on-site similar way, of timelines to show the extinct birds. People could know the first sighting time and extinct time of each bird and explore the specimens information, including collectors, images and collected years, collected by the Bird Division in National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian.
The second one is a unit visualization in which every unit(data point) represents one species of birds. All points are color encoded and could be filtered by conservation status and could be re-arranged in different views, for example, be transferred into a bar chart or a relationship network, to observe the data in various perspectives,

### Design Iteration

## Data sources
### The [Searchable Collection Database](https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/birds/) of The Division of Birds, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institute
The Division of Birds houses and maintains the third largest bird collection in the world with over 640,000 specimens. Its National Collection has representatives of about 85% of the approximately 10,000 known species in the world's avifauna.
### The Birds Catalog in Wikipedia

## Next steps or Future work
1. To make the virtual specimens more vivid, which means the experience of seeing the specimens could be more lifelike. This issue could be solved by 3D display, which is a mature web technology. However, I think this is relying on the potential future work of Smithsonian.
