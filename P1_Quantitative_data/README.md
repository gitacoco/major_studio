# Project 1: Visualize Quantitative Data

## Initial motivation
1. To digitize the bird specimen collections in museum, bringing them to the stage. And taking advantage of the web technology to enable more people to see the appearance of those extinct birds.
2. To draw people's attention and to evoke responses on the issue of birdsâ€™ habitat destruction caused by human activities.

## Questions
Museums always display animal specimen collections, such as bird specimens, on the wall in a matrix-like way, no matter far at National Museums of Kenya or nearly at the National Museum of Natural History of Smithsonian. In on-site settings, those layouts give people a special sense of rhythm and beauty. However, if we're talking about collection digitization, we may be able to do something more. Taking pictures and make them accessible online is still a replication of the traditional on-site exhibition, which has not taken advantage of the digital interfaces.
So questions:
1. How to incorporate multiple dimensions of Information on the basis of displaying specimens.
2. How to engage people to discover the collections.

## Data sources
### The [Searchable Collection Database](https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/birds/) of The Division of Birds, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institute
The Division of Birds houses and maintains the third largest bird collection in the world with over 640,000 specimens. Its National Collection has representatives of about 85% of the approximately 10,000 known species in the world's avifauna.
